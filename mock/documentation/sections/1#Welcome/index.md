# Welcome
Doc Ez 👨🏻‍⚕️, a documentation creation connoisseur, was on the hunt for a documentation creation tool he could take with him to every project. "Why can't there just be a tool that recursively generates a tree representation of my directory and unlimited subdirectories of markdown files, transforms that tree into html, includes a dev server and build system, and requires almost no boilerplate?" he exclaimed.

Doc Ez proceeded to build the tool of his dreams. Once finished, he humbly published his life's work to interwebs for other fellow documentation enthusiasts to enjoy.
